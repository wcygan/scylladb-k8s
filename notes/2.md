# Solved the storage issue

It appears that the scylla-api pod is not deploying properly. The logs show the following:

```bash
Insufficient Disk Space:
- Error Message: ERROR:root:Filesystem at /var/lib/scylla/data has only 2977710080 bytes available; that is less than the recommended 10 GB. Please free up space and run scylla_io_setup again.
```

I eventually was able to resolve this after re-creating my entire k8s cluster using Talos Linux and using this [guide](https://docs.scylladb.com/operating-scylla/procedures/setting-up-disk-storage/).

```bash
kubectl get storageclass
NAME               PROVISIONER        RECLAIMPOLICY   VOLUMEBINDINGMODE      ALLOWVOLUMEEXPANSION   AGE
openebs-hostpath   openebs.io/local   Delete          WaitForFirstConsumer   false                  94m
```
