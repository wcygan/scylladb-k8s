# 1st note

I've been trying to follow https://operator.docs.scylladb.com/stable/installation/helm.html to no avail.

I keep getting stuck deploying the `scylla` cluster helm chart (after installing `cert-manager` and `scylla-operator`). 

The most obvious issue is that I don't have enough resources on my machines (which is odd, they should have 500GB SSDs, not 16GB SSDs). So, I'm not sure what's going here but there are two things I can try:

1. Rebuild my cluster using Talos Linux
2. Try this on a Minikube cluster (give it extra disk space)

Below is a summary of where I'm getting blocked:

## Disk Space Issue on Fedora

Based on the output of `df -h`, it appears that the root filesystem (`/`) on your Fedora system is set up with **15GB of disk space**, of which **12GB is used**, leaving **3.5GB available**. This indicates that the system was indeed configured with a relatively small disk allocation for the root partition.

### Key Observations:
1. **Root Filesystem (`/`)**:
   - **Size**: 15GB
   - **Used**: 12GB
   - **Available**: 3.5GB
   - **Usage**: 77%

2. **Other Filesystems**:
   - `/boot` and `/boot/efi` are separate partitions with their own disk allocations.
   - Temporary filesystems (`tmpfs`, `shm`) are in-memory and do not consume physical disk space.

### Why Only 15GB for Root?
The root partition size is determined during the operating system installation. Itâ€™s possible that:
- The installer defaulted to a smaller size for the root partition.
- The disk was manually partitioned, and the root partition was intentionally limited to 15GB.
- The disk itself is small, and the root partition was allocated a portion of it.

### Recommendations:
1. **Monitor Disk Usage**:
   - Keep an eye on the available disk space (`3.5GB`). If it drops too low, the system may become unstable or fail to operate properly.

2. **Clean Up Unnecessary Files**:
   - Remove unused packages, logs, or temporary files to free up space. For example:
     ```bash
     sudo dnf clean all  # Clean up package cache
     sudo journalctl --vacuum-size=100M  # Reduce journal logs
     ```

3. **Expand the Root Partition**:
   - If you have additional unallocated disk space, you can expand the root partition using tools like `gparted` or `lvextend` (for LVM setups). For example:
     ```bash
     sudo lvextend -L+10G /dev/mapper/fedora_ida-root  # Extend the logical volume
     sudo resize2fs /dev/mapper/fedora_ida-root        # Resize the filesystem
     ```

4. **Reinstall with Larger Partition**:
   - If expanding the partition is not feasible, consider reinstalling Fedora with a larger root partition size.

5. **Use External Storage**:
   - If the disk cannot be expanded, consider offloading data to external storage or network-attached storage (NAS).

### Summary:
Yes, your Fedora system was set up with only **15GB of disk space** for the root partition, which is now **77% full**. To avoid running out of disk space, monitor usage, clean up unnecessary files, or consider expanding the partition if possible.
